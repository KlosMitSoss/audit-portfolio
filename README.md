# KlosMitSoss | Auditing Portfolio

**Independent Security Researcher** specializing in blockchain protocol security with demonstrated expertise across diverse implementations - from staking mechanisms and wallet architectures to social platforms and DeFi infrastructure. Currently studying **Computer Science & Sustainability**, focusing on energy efficiency optimization, IoT sensor networks and sustainable computing architectures.

Proven track record with multiple top finishes across major audit competitions, including a 1st place victory on Code4rena. My extensive auditing experience spans liquidity management protocols, launchpad systems, social reputation networks, and wallet implementations, enabling me to identify cross-protocol vulnerabilities and apply security patterns across different domains.
