# KlosMitSoss | Auditing Portfolio

**Independent Security Researcher** focusing on blockchain protocol security with proven experience across a wide range of implementations, including staking mechanisms, wallet structures, social platforms, and DeFi infrastructure. I am currently studying **Computer Science & Sustainability**, with an emphasis on energy efficiency optimization, IoT sensor networks, and sustainable computing architecture.

Proven track record of winning large audit competitions, including a first place on Code4rena. My extensive auditing knowledge encompasses liquidity management protocols, launchpad systems, social reputation networks, and wallet implementations, enabling me to identify cross-protocol vulnerabilities and apply security patterns across different domains.
